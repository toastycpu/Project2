HIG implementation:

For my first HIG implementation I decided to improve my typography to ensure that the text is more legible. I accomplished this through font weight and size adjustments so that they worked in harmony together. Since I was working on the text, it made sense to also make improvments to the button padding and spacing. That way it would reduce the chance of misclicks.

Lastly, I made color adjustmnets to the layout of my app. While reading the HIG documents, I reconsidered my color choices due the topic of color blindness. To make it more inclusive, I researched colors that would work best for colorblindess and implemented those colors to my app.
